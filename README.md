# Medical Anki deck. (CrowdAnki JSON)
Ahoi, 
this is a start for hopefully something big.... maybe at some point it will be the one and only necessary Anki Flashcard set that you will need to studie human medicin.
But until then its just a small continues project of mine in the hopes to bring education to more people and to make it free...
