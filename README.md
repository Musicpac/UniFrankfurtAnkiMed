# Medical Anki deck. (CrowdAnki JSON)
Ahoi, 
this is the start of something big.... maybe at some point it will be the one and only necessary Anki Flashcard set that you will need to studie human medicin (megalomania intensifies).
But until then its just a small continues project of mine in the hopes to bring education to more people and to make it free...

**Experience with deck**

First semester worked → For anatomy I only used this deck and reached 43/50 Points  
Latin → All this deck  
Chem → Partly previous knowledge (NileRed, Ex&F, etc.) and for all chem structes etc. I used this deck  
Bio → This deck was the major part and I also used old exams.  

Second semester → Well idk not perfect  
Anatomy → I already improved on the missing things and it got me through the exams (oral and written but its wasnt perfect → I passed with 80 % or smth  
Biology → More than you need for the practical side of things BUT for the written exam its a bit superficial → currently improving (PLS HELP) → I passed with 18/20 Points but had to do some extra google stuff and old exams  
Biochem → The oral exams can be conquered with this deck dont know about the written yet  
Physio → Went okay

Third Semester → Gotta be honest with yourself but should be fine

fourth Semester and Physikum → Way better then expected → Got a 2 as a average Grade which equates to a B in the American system
so i definitly cant complain
